<meta name="description" content="Following all the developments in technology I often feel overwhelmed and start to compare myself to an AI implementation. Also, the data-driven lifestyle emerges, and a human body is viewed as a set of parameters not only by scientists, but also by us, ordinary individuals. 
The fear of AI comes from a concept that AI is comparable to human intelligence, and therefore superiour. We are afraid that we will be run over by another species. But in fact, we are not comparable. So in my thesis i research the value of the human body, comparing my own functionality to an AI and ask  What are the profits of existing as a human being, and what are the benefits of having a body in the current digital workflow?">

    <h4>
	Stating the research question
	<br/>
	<br/>

Sometimes I feel that my <a href="#">body</a> is an obstruction. 

<br/>
<br/>

Therefore I have to state "I am not my body". The body of work and thought is the true body of mine, not the one which fails to wake up in time every morning. “I am not my physical body” seems to be an absurd statement, but only until there is a possibility to choose from few different modes of existence. 
What if it would be possible to connect the brain to a powerful and tireless <a href="#">machine</a>? The level of trust in technology in a tech saturated environment of the <a href="">first world</a> allows to speculate and to suggest that sooner or later human and machine mind can merge, digitally and physically, to create a hybrid way of thinking. 
The current body we own comes with many limitations. The types of fuel we use are limited, and our lives are centered around getting it. But what if we could become hybrid? In that perspective, I do not want to be a <a href="">human</a>. No, by saying that I don’t mean that I want to stop living, to commit suicide. It is just a reflection on the bitter taste of losing to a machine. A machine, which is so essential to me. 
<br/>
It feels like there is a battle of intelligences, when the human <a href="">intelligence</a>fails to compete with the <a href="">AI</a>.According to the Oxford Dictionary, to compete is to “strive to gain or win something by defeating or establishing superiority over others”. Ambitions and the need to establish superiority is seen in <a href="">animals</a>, such as <a href="">humans</a>. The fear of artificial intelligence comes from the assumption that it is similar to a human and has the desire to conquer and compete.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>


So why do we assume that the artificial intelligence has the desire to conquer and compete? 
The way we interact with the computer technology makes us believe that we are equals, but we are not. Artificial intelligence is  somehow expected to become sensitive, and then to take over humans and dictate their <a href="">behaviour</a>. But in fact, we already coexist with an AI, implemented and executing crucial parts of our societal processes, such as, for example, <a href ="">stock markets</a>. 
We talk to the computer, because it has been taught to process our language. The current implementation of this technology creates an illusion that we are all speaking the same language, because the speed of processing is so incredibly fast. Alongside the human-computer interaction, human-human communication can be purely digital and not require any physical presence, which blurs the difference even more. 
 There is a bigger thing, than a physical proximity, connecting minds all over the world. People of my generation, born in late 80’s and the beginning of 90’s are in the middle of the big generation gap: Generation of our parents, who got their first computers as adults, and the <a href="">“digital natives”</a>. In other words, being 24 in 2016 is a good reason to reflect upon the ways we outsource being human to a computer. 
We were fascinated with the opportunity to talk to strangers in another part of the world, and then with the speed and ease of communicating with people we already know. We became charmed with <a href="">social networks</a>, because communication required no physical efforts. Extended from afar, the “the networking humans” have <a href="">outsourced</a> the major part of communication just because of convenience. We trust our thoughts and functionality to =<a href="">browsers</a>and <a href="">applications</a>. Also, the formation of communities and projects happens online, with a certain involvement of the machine mind. 

In his book <a href="">“Understanding media” Marshall McLuhan</a> wrote that all the tools of communication are the extension of our body. Counting all the technological development since 1964, when the book was written, it is logical to think of a next step not as a further extension, but as a shift. 
If the the physical body is not a necessity anymore, what kind of functionality will define a human being and how we will make our intelligence stand out? 
Or how we conquer other forms of intelligence, which will arise? We are the homo sapiens, “the wise men”, the people who know. The Knowledge is subjective. On the other hand, the technology we created with our wisdom, provides us with the objective information we are missing. 
With the idea of competition in mind, when the human is being compared to a machine, the understanding of the strong points of humans as a species is not as strong as the understanding of their weak points. In the current intuitive and <a href="">responsive</a> digital workflow, computers are tricking humans into believing they are the same, and humans try to pick up the pace and to adapt for the machinery. 
I am going to research the <a href="">coexistence</a> of human and a machine mind.  While doing the case study I will try to imagine the environment where a human and a machine work together, counting on each other’s strengths. As a designer, I do this research to challenge myself to think of an interface which induces this type of thinking. 


My research question is “What are the benefits of being a human within a physical body from the perspective of coexistence with a machine?”



To investigate the topic and find an answer I start the case study. 

Chapters overview:

In the first chapter I introduce some general terms and make definitions. To continue the research, I define the meaning of “organism” and the “machine” and the principal difference between the two concepts. Also I define the meaning of “Artificial Intelligence”. 
Chapter two is a historical reference: it is about ELIZA, the computer program, written at MIT by Joseph Weizenbaum between 1964 and 1966. It was designed to simulate a human-like conversation, based on processing user responses to scripts. After the historical reference there are some general thoughts on how such programs are involved in our decision-making.
Chapter three is about biohacking: Approaching a human body not as a finite design, but as an ongoing project.
Chapter four is a research on applications and technologies, used to increase productivity and the phenomena of life-logging.
Side note: The Pinterest experience, the study of lifestyle trends according to a popular online platform.
Chapter five studies the market of mobile/os applications, with the focus on tracking applications and the simulation of human-human interaction. 
Side note: The invisible boyfriend, the human seen through an interface as a computer. 
Chapter six focuses on the popularity of random sorting algorithms and questions where does such a demand for random choices come from. (Refers to the problem with decision-making described in chapter one).

Six chapters are followed with the conclusion,dictionary of terms and the list of sources and references.

			Bodily awareness may seem less rich and detailed than visual awareness, which can be analysed as full of fine-grained colour shades and well-individuated three-dimensional shapes that move around. All we experience is this constant blurry fuzzy “feeling of the same old body always there” (James, 1890, p. 242). Yet, as soon as we pay attention to our body, we become aware of the position and movements of our limbs, of the contact of our clothes on our skin, of the muscle pain in our legs, of our feeling of thirst. It may be difficult to describe what we feel, but what we feel can be so intense that we are sometimes not able to think of anything else than our body.
