<div class="text"> <p>Here goes all the text. In the draft of conclusion i wrote that i often feel that my body is an obstruction. Thinking about all the recent developmnent in aftificial intelligence and communication, i think that inhabiting a human body only makes me worse (perfrom worse). It  I say that i don't want to be a human. It's not that i want to stop living/commit suicide, but it's that i feel that i'm loosing to a machine. I think that we sometimes feel that there is a battle of intelligences, when the human intelligence fails to compete with the AI. It's because we think we are equal, we think of competing. But we cannot compete
- because of the eliza effect
What if we start working together, combining our strenghts
while competing with a caomputer, we don;t understand

or probably we lost the sense of understanding what are our strong points as a species. </p></div>
